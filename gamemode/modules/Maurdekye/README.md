# Teleport to Victim

This is a painfully simple script that teleports you to the exact position and angle of the player you kill.
You also get the weapon that your victim was holding when you kill them.

# Random Drops

Caches player locations and uses them to randomly populate ammo and health pickups around the map. Possibly laggy in large maps and with large playercounts.

# Spawn Weapons

Gives the player a crowbar and a random gun on spawn.
